comma zero is a low-cost entry point into the [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) ecosystem. This setup allows you to run the same openpilot as a comma 3X using just a laptop, panda, and webcam.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

The following components are needed to assemble the kit using this housing:

* **Webcam:** [Nexigo N60](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088TSR6YJ) (or other webcam with compatible dimensions)
* **USB Hub:** [ANKER 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L32B9C2) (or similar compact hub)
* **Red panda:** [comma.ai red panda](https://comma.ai/shop/panda)
* **USB A to USB A cable:** Short USB A to USB A cable to connect red panda to the USB hub
* **Mount:** The housing base is compatible with both the official comma 3X mount *and* standard GoPro style mounts

## Assembly

1.  Print the STL file (`comma-zero-case.stl`) from this repository.
2.  Install the red panda, Nexigo N60 webcam, and ANKER USB hub into their designated spots within the housing.
3.  Connect the red panda to one port on the USB hub using the short USB A-to-A cable.
4.  Connect the Nexigo N60 webcam to another port on the USB hub.
5.  Attach the housing to your chosen car mount (comma 3X or GoPro style).
6.  Connect the main USB cable to your laptop.

Software is still a work in progress.
