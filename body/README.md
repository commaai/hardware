Stands
------

For wheeled stands you can use any office chair wheels but we recommend: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088D8XHHQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">these</a>
They are press-fit so you will need to apply some amount of force (or use wise)

Hat (for C3/C3X)
------

After you print a hat and a hat frame you will also need <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93070A107/">4pcs M4x20 screws</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T5L7756/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1">EVA foam</a> to protect the screen of your device. Cut two 9mm x 70mm stripes and apply them to inside of the hat frame.
